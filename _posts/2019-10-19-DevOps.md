DevOps take estaphete of hype from Agile/Scrum.
 
Who is DevOps Engineer? 
How we knew this about Cultrure and Practices, not have strong methodics.

Is that means DevPos Engineer not can be? And this is HR's fantasy?

In common issue - Yeas. This is not profession, it's set of pracices;
In partically - It can be.
I think It may be a man who target to improve dev and operations processes in company.

I'ts like a man who can convert turtle to rabbit.
